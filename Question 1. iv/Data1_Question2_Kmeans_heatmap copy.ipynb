    "We then peformed a Kmeans clustering and grouped the clusters by their mean accessibility. The heatmeap visualizes the clusters: Each row represents a cluster of OCRs grouped by similar accessibility patterns across NK and ILC cell types. The observed differences between clusters — some showing broad accessibility (e.g. cluster 4) — suggest that distinct classes of peaks do exist. This supports the idea that chromatin accessibility varies across cell types and can be used to define functionally distinct groups of regulatory elements. We take a closser look at the cluster that is highly available in NK and ILC subtypes and extract the specific peaks that are in this cluster, to compare if they match with the peaks in the heatmap of atac.ipynb."

Cluster 4, containing the same peaks as cluster 4 in the first heatmap, is still acceessible in all cell subtypes. This suggests, that these peaks are highly conserved. However, the clusters do not show distinct patterns in the different cell types. This does not support the hypothesis, that one can define different classes of peaks according to their signal in different cell types, so we have to investigate further. "
